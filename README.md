# lsv - Vlang implementation of `ls`

`lsv` is a modern alternative to `ls` in the spirit of `exa, eza, lsd, pls, natls, ls-go` and others.

                            where time <string> is an ISO 8601 format.
                            See: https://ijmacd.github.io/rfc3339-iso8601

The -c option emits color codes when standard output is
connected to a terminal. Colors are defined in the LS_COLORS
environment variable.

## Why?

It started with writing a `ls` implemention for the V Language CoreUtils project.
Coreutils is a reimplementation of the POSIX and GNU utility programs written in the V Language. Everything was going fine until I started having too much fun and down the, "Rabbit Hole" I went.

What's this V language? You can read about it [here](https://vlang.io/), but the short version is it is a simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software. I mentioned `lsv` is not written in Rust. I'm not trashing Rust. Rust is obviously a robust and popular language. However, it's a steep climb to get up to speed and requires a fair bit of cognitive load to use it well.

V is the opposite. It has many of the same safty features of Rust, but without the cognitive over head. It's simple, straightfoward syntax makes it a breeze to write. Builds happen in milliseconds, not minutes and hours. You don't need any special build tools like Gradle.

Finally, take a look at the `lsv` code base. The entire code base is **2K lines** üßê. Furthermore, the implemention is straightforward. No threading, coroutines or fancy memory management. Even if you don't know V, I'm betting you will understand the code.
